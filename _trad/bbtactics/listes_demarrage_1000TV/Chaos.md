# Présentation :     

Les équipes du Chaos sont connus pour avoir un démarrage lent mais ont le potentiel pour devenir des équipes formidable une fois bien développées. Le prix de leurs joueurs et leur manque de compétences essentielles au départ peux conduire à de sérieux problèmes durant les quelques premiers matches, jusqu’à ce qu'ils commencent à évoluer et acquérir des compétences.
*Under the latest rules though they have benefited from the extra cash of not needing fan factor and have also had a price drop for their rerolls. With their lack of skills it is probably sensible to start the team with at least three rerolls as you have nothing else to fall back on when you get bad rolls. The other main decision is whether or not to start with a Minotaur on your team and there is debate about having one on the team at all.*

## Tv1000 4 Chaos Warrior Starting Roster:

**Quantité** | **Nom** | **Coût**      
--------|---------|---------
7  | Beastmen | 420
4  | Chaos Warriors | 400
3  | Relance | 180
**Total** |   |  **1000**

*This is probably the most rounded and “safest” way to start a Chaos team. You get all fours Chaos Warriors and an adequate amount of rerolls. Having all four Chaos Warriors increases their chances of getting the MVP and skilling up, though with AG3 though don’t suffer so much from slow progression compared to other ST4 players. You do avoid the trouble of having an unreliable Minotaur as well. The roster is rounded out at a full 1 million, so you don’t have any money to bank towards getting an Apothecary.*



## Tv1000 Minotaur Chaos Starting Roster:

**Quantité** | **Nom** | **Coût**      
--------|---------|---------
9  | Beastmen | 540
1  | Chaos Warrior | 100
1 | Minotaur | 150
3  | Relance | 180
**Total** |   |  **970**

*This roster gets the Minotaur in from the start giving him more games to start gaining SPP, whilst also leaving you with three rerolls. It does mean though that you can only afford to start with one Chaos Warrior so the overall strength is lower. You do have the luxury of 30k banked towards an Apothecary which makes it highly likely you can get one next game. Another option is to drop the Chaos Warrior for a tenth Beastman and starting with an Apothecary, with 20k banked. This can save you a big chunk of cash if the Minotaur gets killed or seriously injured.*



## Tv1000 Reroll Heavy Chaos Starting Roster:

**Quantité** | **Nom** | **Coût**      
--------|---------|---------
9  | Beastmen | 540
2  | Chaos Warrior | 200
4  | Relance | 240
**Total** |   |  **980**

*I always like to include reroll heavy options and seeing how Chaos do rely on rerolls early in their development you can give this option some consideration. Obviously there are drawbacks and for a Chaos starting team this means only being able to afford two Chaos Warriors. Whilst your overall strength is lower you will save money saving up for more Warriors compared to rerolls and having four rerolls can speed up development of your players. You also get 20k banked towards your Apothecary, with the flexibility of horns on all the Beastmen I favour this line-up. In shorter leagues it may not be quite so effective as long term ones though.*



## Tv1000 Reroll Light Chaos Starting Roster:

**Quantité** | **Nom** | **Coût**      
--------|---------|---------
7  | Beastmen | 420
3  | Chaos Warrior | 300
1 | Minotaur | 150
2  | Relance | 120
**Total** |   |  **990**

*The last main choice is to go light on rerolls and really front load your team with all the strong players. I don’t like this choice due to the lack of core skills the team starts with, that doesn’t mean that it can’t work though. An early death before you get an Apothecary can be costly as well. There is an option to swap the Minotaur for the fourth Chaos Warrior and then you can afford to start with an Apothecary as well. Either of those options will leave you for 10k in the treasury to put towards whatever you choose to purchase next. *


# En résumé : 
The starting roster for a Chaos team offers you a few options, and I’ve pointed out what you should consider, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The other things to consider are the length of the league you are playing in and also the other races you will be facing. If you are playing in a fairly bash heavy environment, then getting more stronger players to start with could be useful for example. If you are stuck though, you can’t really go wrong with the first option.
